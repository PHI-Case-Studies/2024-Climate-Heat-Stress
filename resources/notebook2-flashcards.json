The spatial join is an entirely different animal - in that it joins the two tables by the geometry of the spatial coordinates of the target dataset.  In notebook 2 we have performed a spatial join between the health facility shapefile and the netcdf4 temperature data so that we can know the days of deadly heat above 35 degrees Celsius for each health facility.
